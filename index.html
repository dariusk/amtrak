<h1>Automated Amtrak Residency for Writers</h1>
<h3>by <a href="http://twitter.com/tinysubversions">Darius Kazemi</a></h3>
<p>I was on a day trip to NYC from Boston via Amtrak and I was thinking about the <a href="http://blog.amtrak.com/amtrakresidency/">Amtrak Residency</a>. They give select writers a free round-trip train ticket across America along with "a private sleeper car, equipped with a desk, a bed and a window to watch the American countryside roll by for inspiration." I'm interested in <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/">algorithmic writing</a>, and I wondered: what would it be like for an algorithm to be inspired by the rolling countryside?</p>
<p>So on the way from Boston to NYC, I wrote a program that um, "borrows" the current GPS data from the onboard Amtrak wifi server, asks Twitter for an approximation of a place name based on the GPS coordinates, gets 10 nearby tweets (without replies or links or hashtags), and then compiles these into a running "diary." It also grabs a nearby Google Street View image and adds it as an illustration (thanks to Rob Dubbin for the idea).</p>
<p>So I wrote the program on the way to NYC, and I ran it on the way back. What follows here is the journey from Manhattan to Boston. The place names are kind of funny: sometimes Twitter thinks the train is in Canada. While the place names may be off, the Google images are usually pretty on-target (so if it says "Canada" I assure you the image is not actually from Canada).</p>
<p>This trip happened on a Tuesday night at the tail end of Winter, so be prepared for a lot of teens hand-wringing about whether there will be a snow day the next day, and also a lot of talk about Tuesday night's airing of the hit ABC TV series <em>Pretty Little Liars</em>. Enjoy.</p>
